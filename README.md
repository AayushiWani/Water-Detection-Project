# Water-Detection-Project
Automates water body detection using NDWI on Landsat 8 satellite imagery. MATLAB code preprocesses bands, enhances images, computes NDWI, segments water features, and visualizes results. Ideal for remote sensing, environmental studies, and reproducible geospatial analysis.
